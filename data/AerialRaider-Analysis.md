Panoptic audit findings, reveal several areas of risk across various aspects of the system. Here's a summary of the key findings:

Uniswap Fee Collection: Identified a risk in ensuring that the fees collected from Uniswap do not exceed the amount of fees earned by the liquidity owned by the user. This ensures fair distribution of fees in proportion to the liquidity provided by users.

Semi-Fungible Position Manager (SFPM) Liquidity Removal: 
To guarantee that users can only remove liquidity they have personally added, preventing the removal of liquidity owned by other users, which enhances the integrity of user interactions with the SFPM.

Precision Handling in PanopticMath: 
Highlighted the importance of precise and dynamic handling in convert0to1 and convert1to0 functions by adopting appropriate rounding strategies (ceil, floor, round), which is crucial for maintaining accuracy in mathematical operations.

TokenId, LegIndex, and PositionSize Validation: 
Emphasized verifying the legitimacy of tokenId, legIndex, and positionSize before utilizing them in the getLiquidityChunk function to prevent invalid or manipulated inputs from affecting the system.

CreateChunk Function Validations: 
Suggested additional validations in the createChunk function, including checks for _tickLower, _tickUpper, and ensuring non-negative liquidity amounts, to enhance the robustness and reliability of the function.

AMMPool Initialization Checks: 
Recommended enhancements in the initializeAMMPool function with checks for non-zero addresses and the existence of pools, aiming to prevent the initialization of invalid or non-existent pools.

Callback Function Validations: 
Proposed implementing validation checks for amount0Owed and amount1Owed in the uniswapV3MintCallback function, and for amount0Delta and amount1Delta in the uniswapV3SwapCallback function, ensuring the legitimacy and correctness of callback operations.

Position Creation Validations: 
Suggested enforcing rigorous validation checks in the _createPositionInAMM and _createLegInAMM functions to ensure the integrity and security of position creation within the AMM.

Token Transfer Validations in SFPM: 
Proposed enhancements for the registerTokenTransfer function in the SemiFungiblePositionManager contract, emphasizing validity checks and ensuring full balance transfers to maintain consistency and security in token transfers.

LiquidityChunk Library Security: 
Recommended enhancing the security of the LiquidityChunk library by including custom error handling or revert messages for failed operations, improving the system's reliability and user feedback.

These findings collectively aim to enhance the security, reliability, and fairness of the Panoptic system, addressing potential vulnerabilities and ensuring robust operations across various functionalities.
