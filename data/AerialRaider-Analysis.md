Panoptic project audit focused on enhancing security, ensuring proper functionality, and validating crucial processes. Here's a summary of the findings:

Fees from Uniswap Transactions: 
Ensure that fees collected from Uniswap do not exceed the fees earned by the user's owned liquidity. This check is crucial for fair fee distribution and maintaining user trust. Risk Level: Medium.

Liquidity Removal in SFPM: 
Confirm that users of the Semi-Fungible Position Manager (SFPM) can only remove liquidity they have added, preventing unauthorized removal of liquidity owned by others. Risk Level: Medium.

TokenId, LegIndex, and PositionSize Verification: 
Ensure the legitimacy of tokenId, legIndex, and positionSize before they are passed to getLiquidityChunk, enhancing data integrity. Risk Level: Medium.

Validations in createChunk Function: 
Include checks for _tickLower, _tickUpper, and validate that the amount of liquidity is non-negative in the createChunk function. Risk Level: Medium.

Enhancing initializeAMMPool Function: 
Implement Non-Zero Address Check and Pool Existence Check in the initializeAMMPool function for enhanced reliability. Risk Level: Medium.

Validation Checks in Callback Functions: 
Implement validation checks for amount0Owed and amount1Owed in uniswapV3MintCallback, as well as for amount0Delta and amount1Delta in uniswapV3SwapCallback. Risk Level: Medium.

Validation for AMM Creation Functions: 
Enforce rigorous validation checks for _createPositionInAMM and _createLegInAMM functions, ensuring proper functioning and security. Risk Level: Medium.

Enhancements in registerTokenTransfer Function: 
Propose improvements for the registerTokenTransfer function in the SemiFungiblePositionManager contract, including Validity Checks and ensuring the full balance transfer. Risk Level: Medium.

Q/A findings:
Security in LiquidityChunk Library: Enhance the security of the LiquidityChunk library by including custom error handling or revert messages for failed operations. Risk Level: Low.

Precision Handling in PanopticMath Library: Validation for dynamic handling of precision in the convert0to1 and convert1to0 functions, including appropriate rounding mechanisms (up, down, or to the nearest integer). Risk Level: Low.

Each of these points addresses vital aspects of the Panoptic project, highlighting areas where security and functionality can be improved. These findings are crucial for maintaining a robust, secure, and user-friendly environment within the Panoptic ecosystem.
