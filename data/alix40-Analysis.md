This is my second context in Code Arena, and I am really motivated and having a lot of fun auditing the code. 
I had problems understanding the fee calcuation library, it would have been better for me, if they explained the math behind the calculations instead of the illustration they provided.

There a lot of inconsistencies, i found specially in if condition, that are not quite argumented.
