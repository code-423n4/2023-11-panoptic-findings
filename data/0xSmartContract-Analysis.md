## a) The approach I followed when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

|8|Special focus on Areas of  Concern|[Areas of Concern](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic#main-invariants)||

## b) Analysis of the code base

The most important summary in analyzing the code base is the stacking of codes to be analyzed.
In this way, many predictions can be made, including the difficulty levels of the contracts, which one is more important for the auditor, the features they contain that are important for security (payable functions, uses assembly, etc.), the audit cost of the project, and the time to be allocated to the audit;
Uses Consensys Solidity Metrics
-  **Lines:** total lines of the source unit
-  **nLines:** normalized lines of the source unit (e.g. normalizes functions spanning multiple lines)
-  **nSLOC:** normalized source lines of code (only source-code lines; no comments, no blank lines)
-  **Comment Lines:** lines containing single or block comments
-  **Complexity Score:** a custom complexity score derived from code statements that are known to introduce code complexity (branches, loops, calls, external interfaces, ...)

## Entry Point of Project;
<img width="793" alt="image" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic/assets/104318932/f1c88273-f8aa-48e9-a181-6012c591ccc7">

## Protocol Roles;
<img width="1047" alt="image" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic/assets/104318932/e451d56e-3615-4865-8b61-4681d14230f8">

</br>
</br>

## Role 1 : Option Sellers
Sell options by borrowing liquidity for a fixed commission fee and relocating it to a Uni v3 pool. Sellers must deposit collateral and can sell options with notional values up to five times larger than their collateral balance
How does selling options work?
<img width="1422" alt="image" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic/assets/104318932/d42960dd-0ed3-461f-9b1c-162c3ce5d6ba">


</br>
</br>

##  Role 2 : Option Buyers
Buy options by moving liquidity out of the Uni v3 pool back to the Panoptic smart contract for a fixed commission fee. Buyers also have to deposit collateral (10% of the notional value of the option) to cover the potential premium to be paid to the sellers.
How does buying options work?
<img width="1528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic/assets/104318932/ff08102a-164e-4a93-b90b-260ce18f3026">

</br>
</br>

##  Role 3 : Panoptic Liquidity Providers 
Provide fungible liquidity to the options market. This liquidity will be lent out to the options traders to allow them to access trading on leverage. Funds can be deposited into Panoptic pools at any ratio;

<img width="830" alt="image" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-panoptic/assets/104318932/98dc6172-d3f0-4534-bb6d-09a44c342bad">

</br>
</br>

##  Role 4 : Liquidators
Ensure the health of the protocol by liquidating accounts whose collateral balance falls below the margin requirements. Liquidators will receive a [bonus](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations#liquidation-bonus) proportional to:

- The amount of funds necessary to cover the distressed positions
- The distance between the strike and the current price
- The in-the-money amount (intrinsic value)

The most fundamental point of the project and the most critical area to look at for security is the architecture below, which starts with `burnTokenizedPosition` and `mintTokenizedPosition` and transferred to uniswap V3 with `swapInAMM`. Therefore, we should take a closer look at this architecture and examine it in the first place;

## c) Test analysis
### What did the project do differently? ;
-   1) It can be said that the developers of the project did a quality job, there is a test structure consisting of tests with quality content.

-   2) Overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests : 100 




### What could they have done better?


-  1) In order to understand the test scenarios and develop more effective test scenarios, the following bob, alice and other roles are can be defined one by one, in this way role definitions increase the quality and readability in tests

```solidity

 // Sample labels
vm.label(bob, 'bob');
vm.label(alice, 'alice');
vm.label(DEPLOYER, 'deployer');
vm.label(USDE_OWNER, 'usde owner');
vm.label(POOL_PROXY, 'lending pool');
```
</br>

-  2) Test suites do not test for re-entrancy Test teams are testing many functions and variables, but recently, due to the vulnerability in the Vyper Compiler, the hacking of the projects using certain Vyper compiler and losing 50 million $ has revealed the security weakness here. 
https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-finance-pools-exploited-over-24-reentrancy-vulnerability
The accuracy of the functions has been tested, but it has not been tested whether the nonReentrant modifier in the function works correctly or not. For this, a test must be written that tries to reentrancy and was observed to fail.

</br>

-  3) If we look at the test scope and content of the project with a systematic checklist, we can see which parts are good and which areas have room for improvement As a result of my analysis, those marked in green are the ones that the project has fully achieved. The remaining areas are the development areas of the project in terms of testing ;

-  4) Based on the summary of the 'Math.sol' smart contract test file, it seems that the current tests cover a range of success and failure scenarios for various functions. However, there are additional tests that could be added to further ensure the robustness and reliability of the contract. Here are some suggestions:

        assertEq(returnedResult, expectedResult, "mulDiv192 should correctly round up the result");
    }

```

</br>


## d) Security Approach of the Project

### Successful current security understanding of the project;

1 - First they did the main audit from ABDK and OpenZeppelin and resolved all the security concerns in the report 

2- They manage the 2nd audit process with an innovative audit such as Code4rena, in which many auditors examine the codes.


### What the project should add in the understanding of Security;

1- By distributing the project to testnets, ensuring that the audits are carried out in onchain audit. (This will increase coverage)

2- After the project is published on the mainnet, there should be emergency action plans (not found in the documents)

3- Add On-Chain Monitoring System; If On-Chain Monitoring systems such as Forta are added to the project, its security will increase.

For example ; This bot tracks any DEFI transactions in which wrapping, unwrapping, swapping, depositing, or withdrawals occur over a threshold amount. If transactions occur with unusually high token amounts, the bot sends out an alert. https://app.forta.network/bot/0x7f9afc392329ed5a473bcf304565adf9c2588ba4bc060f7d215519005b8303e3

4- After the Code4rena audit is completed and the project is live, I recommend the audit process to continue, projects like immunefi do this. 
https://immunefi.com/

5- Pause Mechanism
This is a chaotic situation, which can be thought of as a choice between decentralization and security. Having a pause mechanism makes sense in order not to damage user funds in case of a possible problem in the project.

6- Upgradability
There are use cases of the Upgradable pattern in defi projects using mathematical models, but it is a design and security option.

7- Emergency Action Plan
In a high-level security approach, there should be a crisis handbook like the one below and the strategic members of the project should be trained on this subject and drills should be carried out. Naturally, this information and road plan will not be available to the public.
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1DaAiuGFkMEMMiIuvqhePL5aDFGHJ9Ya6D04rdaldqC0/mobilebasic#h.27dmpkyp2k1z

8- ChainAnalysis oracle
With the ChainAnalysis oracle, OFAC interaction can be blocked so that legal issues do not arise

## g) Other recommendations

‚úÖ The use of assembly in project codes is very low, I especially recommend using such useful and gas-optimized code patterns; https://github.com/dragonfly-xyz/useful-solidity-patterns/tree/main/patterns/assembly-tricks-1

‚úÖ A good model can be used to systematically assess the risk of the project, for example this modeling is recommended; https://www.notion.so/Smart-Contract-Risk-Assessment-3b067bc099ce4c31a35ef28b011b92ff#7770b3b385444779bf11e677f16e101e

‚úÖ All staff accounts for the project should have control policies that require 2FA and must use 2FA wherever possible.
100% comprehensive security cannot be achieved based on smart contract codes alone.
Implement a more comprehensive policy to enforce non-SMS 2FA.
You can find the latest Simswap attack on Code4rena and details about it in this article: 
https://medium.com/code4rena/code4rena-twitter-x-incident-8b7f308a555d

‚úÖ The Reentrancy modifier used by Opensea is more gas optimized and battle tested, I recommend you replace the reentrancy structure in the project with this code;
https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/main/contracts/lib/ReentrancyGuard.sol

‚úÖ I recommend you to set up a `system.sol` basic architecture where all contracts are registered.
The entire system can revolve around a single contract, like SystemRegistry. This is the contract that ties all the other contracts together, and from this contract we should be able to list all the other contracts in the system. It's almost like a registry. 

‚úÖ Math.sol contract has been partially forked from Uniswap V3, it would be a more accurate approach in terms of security to specify where Math.sol was forked. There is no information about this in the NatSpec comments.

‚úÖ Analyze the gas usage of each function under various conditions in tests to ensure efficiency and identify potential optimizations.	

‚úÖ I recommend running the test files in the same solidity version as the contracts, for example, the solidity version of the `SemiFungiblePositionManagerHarness.sol` file, which is the most important file of the control, is `pragma solidity = 0.8.18`, while the test file is `pragma solidity ^0.8.0`, it is recommended to choose the same structure for full coverage. is done

‚úÖ `Multicall.multicall()` function is common pattern used in Ethereum smart contracts to execute multiple calls in a single transaction. This is particularly useful for optimizing transaction costs and efficiency. The original of this pattern is also available in Uniswap v3.

Raw Revert Reason: It reverts with the raw error message directly from the call. This approach is straightforward but might not always provide clear, human-readable error messages.

Therefore I recommend updating it


```diff
contracts/multicall/Multicall.sol:
  12:     function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) public payable returns (bytes[] memory results) {
  13:         results = new bytes[](data.length);
  14:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; ) {
  15:             (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);
  16: 
  17:             if (!success) {
  18:                 // Bubble up the revert reason
  19:                 // The bytes type is ABI encoded as a length-prefixed byte array
  20:                 // So we simply need to add 32 to the pointer to get the start of the data
  21:                 // And then revert with the size loaded from the first 32 bytes
  22:                 // Other solutions will do work to differentiate the revert reasons and provide paranthetical information
  23:                 // However, we have chosen to simply replicate the the normal behavior of the call
  24:                 // NOTE: memory-safe because it reads from memory already allocated by solidity (the bytes memory result)
- 25:                 assembly ("memory-safe") {
- 26:                     revert(add(result, 32), mload(result))
- 27:                 }

‚úÖ  I recommend that when designing economic models, boundary conditions should be thoroughly tested, and liquidity and price calculations should be strictly evaluated, rather than relying on inequality checks.
Kyberswap was a platform that used Uniswap v3 pools and was hacked for this very reason and suffered a loss of $54 Million;

Test functions appear to be well-structured for testing key aspects of a liquidity pool, including boundary conditions, liquidity calculations, and price impacts. However, it's important to note;
Given the dynamic nature of DeFi and the lessons learned from incidents like the Kyberswap hack, it's vital to continuously review and update the test suite to cover new scenarios and potential vulnerabilities.

## h) New insights and learning from this audit 

üîé 1. SemiFungiblePositionManager Struct
A gas-efficient alternative to Uniswap‚Äôs NonFungiblePositionManager that manages complex, multi-leg Uniswap positions encoded in ERC1155 tokenIds, performs swaps allowing users to mint positions with only one type of token, and, most crucially, supports the minting of both typical LP positions


üîé 2. CollateralTracker Struct
Each time positions are minted, burned, or rolled in Panoptic, the CollateralTracker updates the collateral balances and provides information on the collateral requirement, ensuring that the protocol remains solvent and we retain the ability to liquidate distressed positions when needed.

üîé 3. PanopticPool Struct
It is responsible for orchestrating the required calls to the SFPM to actually create option positions in Uniswap, tracking user balances of and accumulating the premia on those positions, and calling the CollateralTracker with the data it needs to settle position changes.

üîé 3. Great NatSpec Descriptions
The greatest thing you learned from the project was; These are NatSpec comments with great explanations and infographics. This is the best example I have ever seen, I must say that the developers have done an excellent job here, this method makes the codes more understandable and easier to control.

Here are some of them;
