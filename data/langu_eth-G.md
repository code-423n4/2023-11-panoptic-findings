Can Make The Variable Outside The Loop To Save Gas

When you declare a variable inside a loop, Solidity creates a new instance of the variable for each iteration of the loop. This can lead to unnecessary gas costs, especially if the loop is executed frequently or iterates over a large number of elements.

By declaring the variable outside the loop, you can avoid the creation of multiple instances of the variable and reduce the gas cost of your contract. Hereâ€™s an example:

```
contract MyContract {
    function sum(uint256[] memory values) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 total = 0;
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
            total += values[i];
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```

```
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; ) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);
```
